"""Image-derived numerical thresholds for the pipeline.

Every stage of the pipeline (skeletonize, segment, graph, vectorize,
optimize) accepts a constellation of numerical tolerances. Most of
them are *pixel distances* tuned for a "typical" hand-drawn stroke
on a roughly-1k canvas — concretely, the test images here have
stroke widths around 3 px, and the configs in ``default_pipeline``
were tuned against that. When the input is at a different scale
(a tiny 256×256 sketch with 1 px strokes, a high-res 4096×4096 sketch
with 12 px strokes), those tolerances need to scale with it or the
pipeline misfires — junctions don't merge, holes don't fill, the
solver over- or under-snaps endpoints, etc.

This module computes one number from the binary image — the
characteristic stroke width — and emits a full config tree with every
pixel-distance threshold scaled relative to that. The reference
stroke width is 3.0 px (the median of the bundled examples), so for
images at that scale every derived value equals the hand-tuned
default.

Knobs deliberately NOT scaled by stroke width:

* Indices and counts (``lookback``, ``tangent_sample``,
  ``crossing_tangent_skip``, …) — these are along-polyline window
  sizes that depend on skeleton sampling density, which is one
  sample per pixel regardless of stroke width.
* Angle thresholds in degrees (``cusp_angle_threshold_deg``,
  ``min_tangent_spread_deg``, ``line_angle_tol_deg``) — these
  encode perceptual judgments about corners/curves and are
  scale-invariant.
* Ratios and dimensionless weights (``fat_ratio``,
  ``min_tangent_score``, ``corner_threshold``, ``gap_penalty``,
  ``curvature_penalty``, ``pixels_per_inch``, beautify ``_rel``
  tolerances, …) — these are unitless and don't depend on image
  scale.
* Algorithm-choice flags (``method``, ``merge_arcs``,
  ``reskeletonize``) — these aren't numerical thresholds.

If you find a parameter here that should also vary with image scale
but doesn't, that's a bug — fix the derivation rather than re-tuning
all the call sites.

    Mechanism: the Euclidean distance transform of the stroke mask
    gives, at every stroke pixel, the distance to the nearest
    background pixel. Half the stroke width at that pixel.

    Using the *median* across stroke pixels (rather than the max or a
    high percentile) is the most stable estimator across hand-drawn
    inputs:

    * The max is dominated by any pathologically fat blob — a single
      filled-in cell or a thick joint inflates the estimate.
    * High percentiles (p80, p95) overweight the medial-axis pixels
      and yield numbers ~1.5× the actual stroke width.
    * The median takes the central pixel of the typical stroke cross-
      section, which is consistently ~half the stroke width across
      most of the drawing. For a uniform stroke of width W, half the
      stroke's pixels have dt ≥ W/4, so 2 × median(dt) ≈ W/2 — close
      to the perceived stroke width.

    Hand-drawn examples in this repo come out at 2.8–4.5 px with this
    estimator, matching the visual stroke width and the regime the
