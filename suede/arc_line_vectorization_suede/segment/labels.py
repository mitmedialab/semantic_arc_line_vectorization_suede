"""Map every pixel of the final segmentation back to a raw segment.

A "raw segment" here is one polyline emitted by ``trace_skeleton``
after the short-polyline filter — i.e. the first thing the segment
pipeline produces, before fusion, repair, and the second fusion pass.

The downstream stages need to be able to answer "this pixel of the
final polyline came from which raw segment?". Maintaining that mapping
through the fuse/repair/fuse cascade as an explicit per-pixel label
array carried alongside each polyline is feasible but invasive — every
helper that concatenates, splices, or interpolates polyline pixels
would need a parallel branch for the label array.

We do it after the fact instead, by nearest-neighbour lookup against
the raw segments. Every final-polyline pixel takes the raw-segment id
of its spatially closest raw pixel; consecutive pixels with the same
id are then compressed into ``RawSegmentSpan`` runs that tile the
final polyline (no gaps, no overlap by construction).

This works because the transformations that produce the final
polylines move pixels by at most O(stroke-width):

* Fusion concatenates raw polylines and splices in a thin connecting
  path through ink — the bridge pixels sit between the two adjoining
  raw segments' endpoints, so each bridge pixel is closer to its
  side's raw segment than to the other.
* Repair replaces a junction-affected index range with the LS-solved
  junction point plus interpolated bridge points — those new pixels
  sit near the original junction cluster, so the nearest raw pixel is
  in the raw segment that contributed the cluster.
* Post-repair fusion is again a concatenation, with no new pixels.

Bridge pixels that fall exactly on a perpendicular bisector between
two raw segments tip arbitrarily but consistently, which is fine —
the resulting span boundary lands a pixel either way.

class RawSegmentSpan:
    """A contiguous run of final-polyline pixels that all map to the
    same raw segment.

    ``start`` is inclusive and ``end`` is exclusive (Python-slice
    convention): ``final_polyline[span.start:span.end]`` is the range
    of points credited to ``raw_segment_id``.

    The spans for a single final polyline tile ``[0, len(polyline))``
    with no gaps and no overlap — together they reconstruct the
    polyline exactly.

    ``raw_start`` and ``raw_end`` are INCLUSIVE on both ends — the
    first and last raw-segment indices the span touches, walking the
    final polyline in its native order. If ``raw_end >= raw_start``
    the contribution walks the raw segment forward; if
    ``raw_end < raw_start`` it walks it backward (fusion can splice a
    raw segment in reverse). To extract the raw-segment slice
    regardless of direction, use
    ``raw_segments[id][min(raw_start, raw_end) : max(raw_start, raw_end) + 1]``.
    Keeping these inclusive avoids the ``-1`` edge case a half-open
    reverse interval would land at when ending at raw index 0.
